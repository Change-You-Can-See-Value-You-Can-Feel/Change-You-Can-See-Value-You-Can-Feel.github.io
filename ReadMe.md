<h2>What We Stand For â€“ An SHSG That Truly Makes a Difference</h2>

<p>
  We believe in an SHSG that is transparent, responsive, and committed to real change. Student concerns should be heard, decisions should be open, and campus life should be improved with tangible actions.
</p>

<p>
  Our goal is to go beyond promises and deliver meaningful improvementsâ€”from better study spaces to a more vibrant campus culture.
</p>

<h2>Our Concrete Plans â€“ More Than Just Promises</h2>

<details>
  <summary><strong>1. More Study Spaces â€“ Because Learning Shouldnâ€™t Be a Competition</strong></summary>
  <p>
    With 10,000 students but only 5,000 study spaces, finding a place to study is a daily struggle.
  </p>
  <p>We will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>âœ… Expand study space capacity by optimizing existing areas and creating new ones.</li>
    <li>âœ… Collaborate with the university to repurpose underused spaces.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>2. More Microwaves on Campus â€“ Expanding Convenience for Students</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Current microwaves donâ€™t meet demand, leading to long wait times.
  </p>
  <p>We will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>âœ… Add microwaves at key locations, especially at Mensa A.</li>
    <li>âœ… Ensure better distribution across campus for easier access.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>3. A Bigger Adhoc â€“ More Space for Student Life</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Adhoc is a key part of student culture, but its size limits participation.
  </p>
  <p>We will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>âœ… Expand Adhoc to accommodate more students.</li>
    <li>âœ… Enhance event accessibility so no one is left out.</li>
    <li>âœ… Strengthen campus culture with more space for engagement.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>4. Keeping Study Spaces Open &amp; Rethinking Campus Closures</strong></summary>
  <p>
    This year, students lost access to study spaces for two weeks during exam season.
  </p>
  <p>We will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>âœ… Ensure co-working spaces remain open during study phases.</li>
    <li>âœ… Advocate for broader university access during critical periods.</li>
    <li>âœ… Discuss with the administration to prevent full campus closure over Christmas.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>5. A More Transparent SHSG â€“ Open Decision-Making for Students</strong></summary>
  <p>
    SHSG represents all students, but too often, key decisions happen behind closed doors without enough student input.
  </p>
  <p>We will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>âœ… Push for open and accessible SHSG meetings, where students can directly engage with leadership.</li>
    <li>âœ… Provide clear updates on major decisions through easy-to-access summaries and Q&amp;A sessions.</li>
    <li>âœ… Ensure more student participation in key decision-making processes, so everyone has a say in shaping their university experience.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>6. A More Vibrant Campus â€“ Strengthening Community and Traditions</strong></summary>
  <p>
    University life is more than academics.
  </p>
  <p>We will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>âœ… Create more interactive student spaces.</li>
    <li>âœ… Organize more networking &amp; cultural events.</li>
    <li>âœ… Continue the Christmas event at the Square, making it an annual tradition that brings students together and fosters a stronger sense of community.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

  <!-- Candidate Description -->
  <p>
    Iâ€™m Leonardo Moser, and I am running to be your next SHSG President. My goal is to make student life at HSG more transparent, accessible, and engaging. With experience in leadership, student initiatives, and campus life, I want to bring real, achievable improvements to SHSGâ€”ensuring that every student has a voice and that decisions are made openly and with impact.
  </p>
  <h4>About Me</h4>
  <p>
    Currently, I work as Deputy Managing Director of Bereich G, managing the operations of [ad]hoc, MeetingPoint, and Square Bar at HSG. My journey started as a bartender, where I learned firsthand how to work with students, organize events, and manage daily operations. Over time, I moved into leadership, overseeing finances, team coordination, and strategic planning for these student spaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond Bereich G, I am also President of the Bernerverein, where I organize events, foster student connections, and strengthen the student community. This role has taught me how to bring people together, listen to their needs, and improve student life at HSG.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another important part of my journey is that I am in Assessment 2.0. I have no problem being open about this because transparency mattersâ€”both personally and in how SHSG should operate. Students should have clear communication about decisions that affect them, and I will make sure that SHSG becomes more open and accessible for everyone.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before coming to HSG, I built a strong foundation in business and finance through my apprenticeship at Helvetia, gaining practical experience in customer service, administration, and problem-solving. Later, I completed the Passerelle, bridging the gap between vocational training and university studiesâ€”an experience that reinforced my resilience, adaptability, and strong work ethic.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, I want to bring my leadership experience, student-first mindset, and problem-solving approach to SHSG, ensuring that student needs are heard and meaningful improvements are made.

  <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #007030;">Committed to Real Change for HSG Students</h4>
  
  <!-- Candidate Description -->
  <h4>About Me</h4>
  <p>
    Iâ€™m Julian Bodenmann, and I am running to be your next SHSG Vice President. As a fourth-semester Law and Economics student at HSG, I am passionate about making student life more effective, inclusive, and impactful.
  </p>
  <p>
    My experience spans both academia and leadership. I have completed internships in a legal environment, where I developed analytical and problem-solving skills. Before that, I worked as a music teacher at two music schools, taking on responsibility at a young age, managing students, and honing my ability to communicate and lead. These experiences have strengthened my ability to work in a team, navigate challenges, and push for real results.
  </p>
  <p>
    I know, firsthand, how demanding life at HSG can beâ€”whether itâ€™s balancing studies, work, or extracurricular commitments. Thatâ€™s why I want to make student representation more accessible, transparent, and effective, ensuring that SHSG truly addresses the needs of all students. I believe in clear communication, practical solutions, and real advocacy to create a better student experience for everyone.
  </p>
  <p>
    With my hands-on leadership experience and solution-oriented mindset, I am ready to take action. As SHSG Vice President, I will work to ensure that student concerns donâ€™t just get heard but lead to meaningful change.
